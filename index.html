            <p class="about-description">
                I'm Paschal Chukwubuikem Ifewulu Francis, an Applied Computer Science student at Thomas More University of Applied Sciences in Geel, Belgium. I'm currently in the second year of a three-year program, where I specialize in Artificial Intelligence and creative digital storytelling through editing and animation.
                <br><br>
                Since moving to Belgium alone at a young age, I've grown through every challenge — gaining not only technical expertise but also invaluable soft skills like leadership, discipline, and adaptability. My journey has been a balance of academic dedication and sporting excellence. As someone excelling in both tech and a competitive football career, I’ve learned how to manage time, pressure, and expectations with focus and heart.
                <br><br>
                I’ve had the privilege of sharing my knowledge in impactful ways — contributing to communities and helping others grow. I live by two principles: <strong>“Never give up”</strong> and <strong>“Only promise what you can keep.”</strong> I'm a naturally curious, energetic, and optimistic person who believes that limits are only starting points. My dreams are big, my ambition is strong, and my journey is just getting started — both on the field and behind the screen.
